## Getting Started

1. Open the folder where you want to have your project and open cmd
2. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/anviiiijain/e-commerce-frontend.git`


## Git Commands

use `git add .` to add all modified files or `git add <filename>` to add a speciific file to staging

use `git commit -m <message>` to commit all the files from staging

use `git push origin <branch name>` to sync Github with your local changes

use `git pull origin <branch name>` to sync up your local repository with Github (always pull before pushing)

to create a branch use `git branch <branch name>` or `git checkout -b <branch name>`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
